wordle is a popular word game similar to hangman where a 5 letter word is guessed to obtain information to help with the next guess
black implies the letter does not exist in the word
yellow implies the letter does exist but was filled in the wrong position
green implies the letter was added to the correct position

The objective of this program was to automate the guessing process using a GUI which can be easily accessed by the user
A premade text file containing a large amount of 5 letter words was used and list comprehension was used to reduce the number of possibilities
